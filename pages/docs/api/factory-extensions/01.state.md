## State

```tsx
// Create a new state
const myState = state( initialState )

// Get current state value
console.log( myState.value )

// Set new value (will trigger a component update)
myState.value = newValue
// -> Dom not updated yet

// After setting using .value, component is not refreshed instantanously
// Use .set to wait for component invalidation
await myState.set( newValue )
// -> Now the dom is updated
```

> __Note__ : setting a new state is asynchronous because all state changes of a component are stacked and component renders only once for better performances.
> After the component is refreshed, the `await state.set( value )` promise will be resolved.

Additional options for state are
- `filter` to change value when set, useful to avoid invalid values
- `directInvalidation` is called after the associated component is rendered

```typescript
const myState = state( 0, {
    // Value is filtered when "myState.value = something" or "myState.set( something )" is used. 
    // Here value cannot be set bellow 0 
    filter: (newValue, oldValue) => Math.max( newValue, 0 ),
    // Will force component to be rendered after each set
    // It can be useful if you need sync data rendering
    // But be careful about data flow, it can destroy performances in loops !
    directInvalidation: true
})

// Value is 0 and DOM is directly updated
myState.value = -2

// Because of directInvalidation, it will render component at each loop and your app will certainly crash
for ( let i = 0; i < 10000; ++i)
    myState.value ++
```
