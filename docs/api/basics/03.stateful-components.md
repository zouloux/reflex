## Stateful components with factory pattern

This is where it changes from React. Stateful components in Reflex follows the __Factory Component Pattern__. __[Factory extensions](#factory-extensions)__ are used __only__ in the "factory phase" of the component.

```tsx
function StatefulComponent ( props ) {
    // This is the "factory phase"
    // This part of the component is executed once, when component is created, and not at each render.
    
    // Create a state for this component, like in React or Solid
    const currentNumber = state( 0 )
    const incrementNumber = () => currentNumber.value ++
    
    // The component needs to return a function which will render the component
    return () => <div class="StatefulComponent">
        {/* Update state when button is clicked */}
        <button onClick={ incrementNumber }>
            Click to increment current number: { currentNumber.value }
        </button>
    </div>
}
```

> Stateful components are not __pure__. Output differs even with the same props as input.
