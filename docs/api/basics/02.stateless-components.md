## Stateless and pure components

Stateless, or components without logic can avoid the factory pattern. Simply return the virtual-dom tree derived from props like you would do it in React or Preact.
Stateless functions are [__pure__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function), which means it has always the same output (returned elements) for a specific input (props).
```tsx
function StatelessComponent ( props ) {
    return <div class="StatelessComponent">
      Hello { props.name } ðŸ‘‹
    </div>
}
```

> Because Stateless and Stateful components are written differently, Reflex can  optimize render of Stateless components by keeping old virtual-node tree, if props did not change between renders. We have better performances without adding any logic to our app.

> Also, `shouldUpdate` can be set by component (Stateful or Stateless), if you have specific optimization logic to avoid useless renders.
