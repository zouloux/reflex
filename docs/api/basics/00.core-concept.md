## API Concept

```typescript jsx
return () => <div />
```

**Stateful components** will return a __render function__ instead of virtual-nodes directly.
Scope is shared between the factory and the render function.

```tsx
function StatefulComponent ( props ) {
    // Factory extensions and component logic goes here ( factory phase )
    // This part is only executed once, when component is created.
    const number = state( 0 )
    // ...
    // Render function returning node tree goes there ( in a function )
    return () => <div>Current number is { number }</div>
}
```

Reflex allows **functional pattern** for **stateless components**, like React and Preact.

```tsx
function StatelessComponent ( props ) {
	// No state ? No need for factory function here
	return <div>Hello { props.name }</div>
}
```

#### Improvements üëç
- __Simpler__ : Classic React Hooks like `useCallback`, `useEvent` and `useMemo` becomes __useless__ and does not exist in __Reflex__.<br>
- __Fewer bugs__ : [Stale closure issues](https://dmitripavlutin.com/react-hooks-stale-closures/) vanishes.<br>
- __Cleaner__ : Also, hooks dependencies array to keep state scopes ([#1](https://itnext.io/how-to-work-with-intervals-in-react-hooks-f29892d650f2), [#2](https://overreacted.io/a-complete-guide-to-useeffect/)) are not needed with __[factory extensions](#factory-extensions)__.
- __Back to basics__ : Using `refs` to store stateless values does not exist anymore. In __Reflex__, `ref` is used only to target dom node or components, `let` is used to declare local variables like it would normally do.

#### Tradeoffs üëé
- __Stateless vs stateful__ : When a component is evolving from stateless to stateful, the `return <div>...` needs to be refactored to `return () => <div>...`. But stateless components **can** be implemented with factory function.
- __Props__ : Props cannot be destructured in the factory phase [because props is mutated](#props)
- Surely more but I got biases :)
