### Automatic forwardRef

When attaching a ref from inside the component, and from the parent, it will just work as expected.

> No need for forward ref

```tsx
function Child () {
    // Works, will have component instance and div element
    const root = ref()
    return () => <div ref={ root }></div>
}
function Parent () {
    // Also works without forwardRef
    // will have component instance and div element
    const child = ref()
    return () => <div>
      <Child ref={ child } />
    </div>
}
```
> /!\  This feature is WIP and will certainly change in RC
